Description of project
This is a virtual musical instrument made in Godot which replicates
an electric guitar. 

Instructions for use
Press the button on the strings in between the guitar's pickups to play 
the string. Each string has a different sound. The string's pitch can
be altered by pressing another button on the same string at the 
fretboard.

How it works.
Every button in between the pickups corresponds to a code which tells 
the computer to play the sound. Meanwhile, the buttons on the fretboard
are coded to change the sound's pitch, emulating how it would be to 
press the string. Because the GDScript code lets one change the pitch 
as if using a variable, there is no need for if statements or extra 
audio files per pitch change, simply one buttonper increment. The 
fretboard buttons are on a 0.1 increment starting from the right, being 
the first value equal to 1. 

What I am most proud of in the assignment. 
I feel that the aspect I am most proud of for this assignment was how 
I was able to emulate how a real electric guitar would work through 
a simplistic code. Plus I found it really fun to "fiddle" (I don't know
if that's the correct term, but basically change the pitch constantly as
a sound is playing) with the instrument.
